Index: Is used to implement the fast searching of records in table. This improves the query performance on server.

select * from emp--billions of records.

2 types of index:
1)Clustered index  : 
-It can be only 1 in a table .
-If you have PK in a table, automatically it puts the clustered index in that.
-Internally, it does the physical sorting of records

EmpId: PK : 
101 102 103 104 105
select * from emp where id=104

2)Non clustered index :
-It is possibility that you want to search record based on some differnt column.
-Can be around 249 or more in a table. name, address, 
-It does logical sorting of data
  102 106 109 103
