Java :
-It is a programming Language which is used to develop the s/w given by Sun Microsystems.
-James Gosling develop the Java in 1995.
- It is based on oops concepts.
-Every code has to be written using oops concepts, but then also it is not pure oops based language.
-Initially, it was named as OAK, but it was registerd name so, later on they change the name to Java.
-set top boxes,
-Java is an island in Indonesia,  where coffee beans were there. 


Is c++ pure oops based language ?No .
In c++, We can do programming with classes or without classes also.


What do you mean by oops?
- Object Oriented Programming Language
- It is a programming methodology to develop the software.
================================================================================================
Different types of applications :

1)Console Based Application : 
-When you are executing application in console window, where it working based on commands , that is known as Console Based application.
-No User Interface like links, buttons.

2)Desktop/Standalone Application:
-Are those which has to installed on client machine.
-Eg : MS Office

3)Web based application
-Are those that are accessible through browser.
-Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer are browsers.
-Eg : Youtube, Google, gmail, Microsoft, Wikipedia 

4)Mobile based application
-are those which are installed on mobile devices.
-You can install it from PlayStore.
-whatapp, Ola, Zomato
-ios,android, windows

5)Gaming application
-these are speacialized app
-Eg : Playstations

====================================================================================================
Features of Java :

1) Simple : Easy to Learn, syntax are very easy, easy to understand.
2)OOPs : Everything in Java is based on oops.It will use all features like Class, objects,Encapsulation,Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymprphism
3)Platform Independent : 
- Platform : Environment where you are executing code
		- hardware or - software
		-Java is actually providing the software environment-JRE, API
-WORA-Write once, Run Anywhere
- c++ - Write, Build, Run - Windows
Java - platform Independent

4)Portable :We can execute java byte code to any platform.
5)Distributed: Java has the ability to call the files/methods reside on multiple machines/location.
6)Secured: Java is very secured..
- In java, implicitly pointers are maintained. 
- Explicitly, we can't work on pointers.

7)Robust : Java is a strong language
-No explicit pointers are maintained
-Automatic Memory Management (Garbage collection)
-Type checking .

8) Multithreaded: 
- Same memory area can be used to execute multiple threads thus saving memory.

=============================================================================
JDK : Java Development Kit
-  If you want to develop a Java code , the you need JDK in your machine.
-It contains everything required to develop a code.
============================================================================
JRE : Java Runtime Environment
- If you want to execute a Java code, you need JRE in your machine.
-It contains everything which helps to run Java application which is already compiled.
===============================================================================
Java Program gets executed in 2 phase :
1)Compilation Phase
2)Execution Phase: ClassLoader

Java is platform Independent but JRE is platform dependent.
JVM : Java virtual machine
-It is a virtual machine which works over your OS, and it execute the compiled code.
-JVM only works with byte code.
-JVM will convert your byte code and generate the machine specific code.
-JVM takes care of portability.
