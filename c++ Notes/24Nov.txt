Inheritance : We are deriving some properties from our parent.

- Reusing the properties of parent into child.
-  Child is able to access the features of parent 
- No need to redeclare the same properties in the child.
-Using old features + Adding some new features based on requirement 
-You dont need to write the same code/login again and again.


class A
{
public:int width, height;

}
class B :public A
{
//will be able to use the properties like width and height of class A. so no need to redeclare it again and again.

}

--do you update any application in smart phone

Reason ? 

But Is it completely new ?

Old features + we have updated some new features
